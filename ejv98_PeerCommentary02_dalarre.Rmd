## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##HOMEWORK 02

```{r}
l <- 15 ## This establishes lambda = 15
ppois(8, l, lower.tail = FALSE) ## This returns the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session. The lower.tail = FALSE argument makes the function give you the probability of x being greater than 8 instead of lower than 8 which is the default for ppois.
```

```{r}
#Miguel: I think that is the most efficient way to do it! I did not know that option exist; thanks to it now I have realized that my answer is not complete.

#Liz: Everything seemed to run well! I now see what you mean about this being a more efficient way! I am going to give this a try on my own homework. 
```

```{r}
dpois(0,l) ## This returns the probability that she will hear no calls in a session
dpois(3,l) ## This returns the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session
```

```{r}
#Miguel: Correct answers. When coding the "xpois" function I would recommend writing the whole argument, I mean "x = nº" and "lambda = x", at least it works better for my brain to understand what I am doing.

#Liz: This runs well! I did it a bit differently, I believe I did it the same way Miguel mentioned, but it seems right.
```

```{r}
#This code plots the poisson mass function of the values of x from 0 to 30
relevant <- 0:30
y <- dpois(x = relevant, lambda = l)
barplot(y, names.arg = relevant, space = 0, xlab = "Number of calls", ylab = "Pr(X = Number of calls)", main = "Probability Mass Function")
```

```{r}
#Miguel: Good job! You can set the plot in one step if you want: "barplot(dpois(x = relevant, lambda = l), etc" so you do not need to create the vector "y". For me, it also helps to see every part of the coding for the plot in a different line.

#Liz: Nice!
```

```{r}
##This simulates 104 results from this distribution 
x <- rpois(104,l)
x
```

```{r}
#Miguel: You can do it in just one line by "rpois(n = 104, lambda = l)". Maybe you did like this for the histogram of the next question.

#Liz: Runs great! I did it the same way Miguel mentioned by writing it in one line.
```

```{r}
## This plots the simulated results. Probability = TRUE makes the function represent the probabilities instead of the frequencies.
hist(x, breaks = seq(from =0, to = 30, by = 1), probability = TRUE, main = "Plot of 104 simulated results", xlab = "Number of calls", ylab = "Pr(X = Number of calls)", xlim = c(0,30))
## The shape of this plot ressembles the probability mass function, but it doesn`t match perfectly.
#Miguel: Good job! I like how you separated the bars with the argument "by = nº". I did not used the "Probability function". I guess I will need to change that.

#Liz: Great! 
```

## CHALLENGES
I had trouble building the barplot because I didn't understand what the names.arg argument was. I solved it using ?barplot and reading the information.
